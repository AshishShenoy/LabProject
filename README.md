# Python Lab Project
My first lab project written in Python.

This project utilises the concepts of Simple Linear Regression. Through running FinalVersion.py it is possible to plot a best fit line through a set of points inputted either manually or through a comma-separated-values (CSV) file. The program is designed to be used through the python interpreter. An example graph has also been provided.
