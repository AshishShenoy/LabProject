skplot
===

skplot is a small python module/script, that uses the concept of simple 
linear regression to plot a best fit line through a set of points. The 
script is designed to imported through the python3 interpreter. The points 
can be read individually or through a comma-separated value (CSV) file. 
An example graph has also been provided.

To run this module, the following dependencies in the form of Python 3
libraries are needed:

- matplotlib
- pandas

Install these with the command:

    $ sudo pip3 install <library-name>


Download:

    $ git clone https://github.com/AshishShenoy/skplot.git

This was my first lab project in Python 3, and I chose this as I liked 
statistical math, particularly regression and fitting.
